fix converting dxt2/3/4/5 to dxt1 with ck transparency causing weird artifacts

fix saving v16u16 as 48bit png looking fricked up.
    weird thing is the image in the png is exactly how it should look, but it
    isnt being rendered properly. Like, extracting the image data from the png,
    decompressing it, and removing the filter byte from each scanline. That
    will give you back a perfect looking 48bit color rgb image

fix dxt5 alpha generation being screwed for min and max values
