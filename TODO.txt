fix conversions to A16 and A16L16 not working properly

make functions to pad pixel data before swizzling and unpad
after unswizzling so arbytmap is able to work with textures
that aren't a power of 2.
    this will require special care when calculating dimensions
    of unpacked pixels as they will need to be rounded up to
    the nearest power of 2.
